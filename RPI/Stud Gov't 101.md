When people speak of the 'Rensselaer Union', they may be referring to either the [student-run building](The%20Union.md) at the corner of of [Sage and 15th](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rensselaer+Union/@42.7299076,-73.679241,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89de0f9ff3c17227:0xd5d808a8e2c02a72!8m2!3d42.7299076!4d-73.6766661!16s%2Fg%2F11r922zdp?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), or the Student Government it houses. As the name suggests, **all of Stud Govt's voting members/leaders are RPI students**, either elected or appointed by RPI students.

The [Union Constitution](https://rpi.app.box.com/v/rpisg/file/1689369858823) document lays out the structure, below its...

- **Seats**: 29 total, [elected](Stud%20Gov't%20101.md#Elections) by the RPI student body. 7 of the seats are allotted to the [Graduate Council](Graduate%20Council/GC%20Overview.md).

# Elections
A.k.a. the [_GM Week_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Marshal_(RPI)#GM_Week_celebrations), take place in March. This is the time people become desperate to get a 'GM Week Mug' -- a reward for casting your elections vote.
