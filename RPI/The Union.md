# Fitness & Leisure

Keep an eye on a very extensive and constantly updated [list of events](https://union.rpi.edu/events/)! Very often accompanied by free food.

Many fitness opportunities are provided by the [Campus Recreation, Fitness, and Wellness](https://union.rpi.edu/campus-recreation/) center. They offer several gym options that are free for RPI students, including a pool. Most up-to-date is their [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/rpicampusrecreation/?hl=en) including the links for the reservation of affordable on-campus fitness classes and wellness activities. The center also provides and advertises various **student employment opportunities**, so keep an eye on that for some fun part-time jobs!

# Student Government

The Union is home to the [Student Government](https://sites.google.com/view/rpistugov/), a well-established and thriving community that **represents the student body** on a variety of issues. 

Especially the [Graduate Council](Graduate%20Council/GC%20Overview.md) should be of interest to all Grad students, since they take care of the Graduate needs which are very specific. They open new positions throughout the year if you want to be an active voting member and support and help your community.
