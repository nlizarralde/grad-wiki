## Rights & Responsibilities

General RPI student policies are covered by the [Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities](https://rpi.box.com/s/p1b39vybm914b5cao4csrgl84bfrrh2l), which includes topics as peculiar as "Exotic Dancers" – a relic from the past. Any changes to it have to be approved by the students, via the [Student Senate](Stud%20Gov't%20101.md#Student%20Senate).

[The Graduate Student Supplement to the Rensselaer Student Handbook of Rights & Responsibilities](https://graduate.rpi.edu/forms-and-policies), written by the [OGE](Important%20Offices.md#Office%20of%20Graduate%20Education), covers areas specific to us. Importantly, it defines the standards for the relationship with our advisors.

## Communication
...is key to your success in grad school.

Our advisors help and guide us to become independent researchers, able to function in an academic community. As our [Provost](Important%20Offices.md#Important%20People%20on%20Campus) stressed at the Grad Council's first Open Conversation, **constructive, friendly disagreement** should be an essential part of our development.

### Follow-ups
At RPI, we have people from all over the globe with highly diverse backgrounds – misunderstandings happen. To minimize these, it is common after a meeting to share a summary with those present, via email. In some cultures this may be viewed as rude/distrustful. Not at RPI! **Here, follow-ups are a welcomed standard.** All of us learn sooner or later how valuable these are.

### Am I doing fine?
Academia is huge, and highly complex. We just started off discovering it. If you are wondering whether things around you are normal or really need to change, there are impartial people you can ask.
We recommend starting with [Colleen Smith or the Ombuds](Important%20Offices.md#Important%20People%20on%20Campus), who can meet with you one on one, to help better understand the situation, without taking actions.

Should things become more serious, the OGE describes a formal [Complaint Policy](https://graduate.rpi.edu/forms-and-policies), which Colleen and the Ombuds can also advise you on.

For mental health support, see RPI's [Counseling Center](Important%20Offices.md#Counceling%20Center).
