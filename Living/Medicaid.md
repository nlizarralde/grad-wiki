# To Enroll

## Step 1
### > Option A: NY State Of Health Website/Phone
Create an account and open an application on the [NY State Of Health website](https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/). For assistance, call their hotline +1-855-355-5777.

### > Option B: Through a Medicaid Provider
_**Note**: There are several provider options. In this example, we use the Fidelis Care._
- Send a message or call **Patti Marks-Conger** (Health Benefit Representative, Marketing) at (315) 383-7665, indicating your intention to start the application process.
- She will request you to [email her](mailto:pmarks-conger@fideliscare.org) copies of your visa, passport, social security cards, and income information. If your spouse does not have a Social Security Number, it will not be a problem.
- Afterwards, she will contact you to answer some questions and complete the application together.
- Then you can create an account on the Fidelis Care website. There's no need to fill out anything else on the site. Your card will be sent to you by mail.
- Ask Patti a proof of coverage. This is essential for the next step.

ATTENTION: You should annually renew your plan. Thus, schedule an appointment with her every year to handle this.

## Step 2

**Only after you have been approved and received a proof of coverage**, should you proceed to cancel your RPI health insurance. Keep in mind that cancellations can't be made during the semester; they must be initiated before the semester begins. To do this,

- Visit the [RPI Student Health Center website](https://haylor.com/college/rensselaer-polytechnic-institute-rpi/).
	- On the far right, under the "schedule appointments" section, select the bottom option that reads "Insurance enrollment/waivers portal".
	- To cancel your RPI insurance, you'll need the proof of coverage from Fidelis Care that we mentioned earlier.
	- Now, you'll receive an email saying "waiver has been successfully processed and approved".
	- If you don't receive this email or if you have any questions, call (866) 535-0456, or [email Collegiate Department - Haylor, Freyer & Coon, Inc](mailto:student@haylor.com).
- Finally, visit [SIS Website](http://sis.rpi.edu)
	- Select Student Account Detail > Account Summary by Semester, and double check your account balance for the upcoming semester. You should have the “Health Insurance Waiver” in the “Payment” section.
