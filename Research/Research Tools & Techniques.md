# Disclaimer 
The power of the individual tools grows exponentially as you chain them into an academic workflow.


# Text Formatting
- [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/):  very easy to use plain-text cosmetic language.
- [**LaTeX**](https://www.latex-project.org/get/): De-facto standard for all academic publications. Solves a lot of Microsoft Word's problems while introducing new ones. Don't use for note-taking unless you hate yourself.


# Tools
## Literature Research/Management
- [**Research Rabbit**](https://researchrabbitapp.com) : Free online service for literature research.
- [**Zotero**](https://www.zotero.org/) : Use it. Quintessential for any academic. Your life will change. Anyone thinking differently does not know what they are talking about. Offline, Free, Open-Source.
	- **Important**: *Add only papers you read/referenced into it. Otherwise, your library will look like a dumpster.*

## Note-Taking
