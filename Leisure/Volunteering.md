If you are feeling charitable during your time in Troy, there are some places that are looking to have volunteer help. [This link](https://www.troyny.gov/324/Volunteer) takes you to a list of opportunities that are available in Troy and who to contact for each one. In addition to that, [Unity House](https://www.unityhouseny.org/services/volunteer-opportunities/) also offers volunteering opportunities!


# [Mt. Ida Food Pantry](https://www.facebook.com/mountidafoodpantry/)
From the Pantry's organizer, Denise Dunham:
- The First Thursday of every month we receive a large food delivery from the Food bank. Help is needed unloading the delivery truck and organizing the delivery. The truck arrives between 8:45 & 9:00am and it usually takes about 30 minutes to unload the truck(depending on the number of volunteers that show).
- ﻿The First Thursday of the month from 5:15-7:30pm delivered items are inventoried, sorted and stocked in the pantry.
- ﻿EVERY Friday evening from 5:15-7:30pm the pantry service area is set up and prepared for service on Saturday mornings. Tables are set up, produce is organized and labeled, shelves are restocked and other tasks are done to prepare for service Saturday morning.

ANYTIME IS A GOOD TIME TO VOLUNTEER! For more information on how you can help at Mt. Ida Food Pantry, please message Denise at (518) 603-3873.
