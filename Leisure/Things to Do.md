# On the Road

## Hiking
* [Poestenkill Community Forest](https://www.rensselaerplateau.org/poestenkillcommunityforest) - a 436 acre forest roughly a 26 minute drive from campus!
* [Barberville Falls](https://www.rensselaerplateau.org/barbervillefalls) - a 92 foot waterfall about 20 minutes away from RPI!
* [Bessie's Woods](https://www.rensselaerplateau.org/bessies-woods) - a 122 acre woods close to a 30 minute drive from campus!

## Waterfront
The local state parks a really well taken care of. You can swim in the lakes, they have artificial beaches, dressing-/rest-rooms, children playground, grill sites, and more. There is an entrance fee (per car), you can also get a [season pass](https://parks.ny.gov/admission/empire-passport/).
* [Grafton Lakes + State Park](https://parks.ny.gov/parks/graftonlakes) - About 24 minutes away, there is a ton of outdoor activities to do! Very popular, on hot summer days sometimes resembles a Florida beach during Spring Break.
* [Cherry Plains Lake + State Park](https://parks.ny.gov/parks/173/) - About 35 minutes away, it is in the middle of nowhere. It is smaller than Grafton Lake, and therefore less visited -- but just as nice. Good option if you want more quiet at the beach.
## Winter Sports
* If you are itching to ski or snowboard, [this website](https://www.epicpass.com/passes/northeast-value-pass.aspx) will take you to a season pass at a discounted price for college students with access to the nearby slopes!
