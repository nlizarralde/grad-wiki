# "How to Not Screw up Grad School" - an (unofficial) RPI Grad Wiki

## DISCLAIMER

#### Under Construction
This is an [RPI Graduate Council](RPI/Graduate%20Council/GC%20Overview.md) _community-driven_ project, by Grads for Grads, aimed to share the history and insights on how to navigate the world-renowned Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, and beyond.  If you notice something is amiss, it means no one has added it yet. Feel free to be the first to to do so -- [see here](CONTRIBUTE.md)!
#### Errare Humanum Est (lat.)
We do our best to fact-check all entries, but to err is human. Thus, _all information provided and advice given in this Wiki comes without any warranty, whatsoever_. Please double-check before taking action.

## Why a Wiki?
Generally, all experience we accumulate during our stay at RPI leaves with us when we graduate. Through this Wiki, we want to reduce the repetitive trial/error struggles many of us go through when starting out, accelerating our progress towards the finish line (=degree).

## Wiki Structure

### Front-End
For quick a quick lookup/browse, best to use this publicly-facing [Website](https://publish.obsidian.md/rpi-grad-wiki).

**How-to**: On desktop/laptop devices, use the navigation+search pane on the left. On mobile device, press the three lines on the top left corner to bring up navigation.

### Back-End
Open knowledge should not be grounded in a proprietary structure.
The actual Wiki database containing meta-data and all of history lives in this public [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rpi-graduate-council/grad-wiki/). 

**How-to**: You can download the entire Wiki as a zip file, if you prefer to have it on your machine. Written in [MarkDown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/markdown), the _.md_ files can be opened with any plain text editor. For complete functionality, use the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note-taking application. In its folder structure, the folder
- _\_assets_ contains all supplementary materials (pdfs, images, etc.), embedded in the Wiki's pages;
- _.obsidian_ contains Obsidian-related configuration files.
